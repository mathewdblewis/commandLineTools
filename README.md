This repo contains, amoung other things, various scripts I've written
over the years that I use to speed up my workflow, for example, gitish
adds, commits and pushes everything to git, wifi turns my wifi off then
on again (sometimes my wifi is buggy and this helps) and so on. Also
I have other programs such as "subl" (sublime text) etc. Many of these
are very small scripts that just call other scripts.

I also have a folder containing various notes on things I commonly
lookup so that I have a quick reference when nessisary. I hope to
add to this folder so it becomes more comprehensive.

summary:  
notes:    notes on various programming things  
old:      old code that I don't use any more  
progs:    programs that I don't want in my path  
tools:    programs I do want in my path
