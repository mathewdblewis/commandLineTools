This repo contains various programs I've written over the years
that I use to speed up my workflow, for example, gitish adds, commits
and pushes everything to git, wifi turns my wifi off then on again
(sometimes my wifi is buggy and this helps) and so on.

I also have a folder containing various notes on things I commonly
lookup so that I have a quick reference when nessisary. I hope to
add to this folder so it becomes more comprehensive.
