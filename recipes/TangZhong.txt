Ingredients:
Make one bread in a 11,5x22,5 cm – 4,5x9 inch loaf pan

Tang Zhong:
1/4 cup Flour
3/4 cup Water

Milk Bread:
2+2/3 cup Flour
1/2 teaspoon Salt
2 tablespoons Sugar
1+1/4 teaspoon Yeast
1 Egg
1/2 cup lukewarm milk
Tang Zhong
3 tablespoons Butter

Directions:
Prepare the Tang Zhong:
1. In a non-stick pan combine flour and water.
2. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the mixture thickens into a pudding-like consistency, or reach 65°C-150°F.
3. Tranfer into a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and cool down at room temperature.

Prepare the Milk Bread:
1. In a large bowl mix flour and salt.
2. Add sugar, dry yeast and combine.
3. Add the egg (beaten), lukewarm milk and start to combine with a spatula.
4. Add the Tang Zhong and combine with a spatula until reach a very sticky dough.
5. Add the butter (room temperature) and combine with a spatula.
6. Sprinkle the work surface with at least 3 tbsp of flour and start to knead the dough with your hands; if you have a stand mixer you can use it, since the dough is pretty sticky.
7. Incorporate a little flour until knead the dough, but don’t add too much flour: the dough have to remain very soft and slightly sticky*

*NOTE: The consistency of your dough may vary depending of your flour. If your dough seems too wet, you can add up to 1-3 tbsp more flour until the dough comes together but consider that this is a pretty sticky dough. You can use your scraper instead of your hands to help you kneading.

8. Knead for about 15 minutes or until the dough will be smooth and elastic.
9. Form into a ball, place it in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
10. Let it rise in a warm place** for about 45 minutes or until triple in size: the dough will be ready when you poke it and it will maintein its shape.

** I let it rise in a slightly warm oven: I preheat it for about 4-5 minutes at 50°C, then turn it off and place the dough to rise.  

11. Transfer the dough over a silicon pastry mat or a floured surface and split it into 3 equal pieces.
12. Roll each piece into a ball and cover every ball with plastic wrap.
13. Use a rollin pin and roll one piece into a long oval shape.
14. Fold the right third of the oval over the middle, then fold the left third of the oval over the middle.
15. Turn the packet and roll into a rectangular shape.
16. Roll the rectangular from the bottom to get a fat roll.
17. Cover the roll with plastic wrap and repeat with the other 2 pieces of dough.
18. Arrange the 3 rolls of dough into a greased 11,5x22,5 cm – 4,5x9 inch loaf pan.
19. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until the dough reaches the rim of the loaf pan.
20. Brush the top with beaten egg + milk.
21. Bake in preheated static oven at 175°C-350°F for about 25 minutes.

1. mix 40g bread flour with 200g water in a saute pan. Turn on medium heat and keep stirring until mixture thickens to a paste.
2. Refrigerate for 6 hours. Bring out to room temperature 1 hour before use.
3. Add bread flour, sugar, salt, dry yeast, powdered milk to a mixing bowl and mix gently with dough hook attachment.
4. At low speed, mix in milk and egg and Tangzhong so that no flour is visible.
5. Add in room temperature unsalted butter and mix at low speed.
6. Slowly turn up the speed to high and mix until all dough sticks together.
7. Take the dough and fold it around and underneath itself shaping a smooth ball.
   Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 40 minutes to an hour.
8. Test the dough by poking your finger down into the middle. If the dough does not spring back, it is ready.
9. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts (by weight). Take one piece of dough and fold it over itself. Turn it 90 degrees, slap it on table and fold it over itself again. Using both hands, mold the dough into a ball. Repeat with rest of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes.
10. Roll each ball of dough out flat. Fold flatten dough using thirds. Turn 90 degrees, and roll dough into a roll, pinching it together at the seam. Place 3 molded dough into a baking pan and let it rest for 30 minutes, letting it rise.
11. Brush with egg wash and bake in the oven, preheated to 355°F for 25-30 minutes.
