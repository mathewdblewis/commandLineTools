3 cups sweet potatoes (mashed and cooled)
1 1/2 cups brown sugar (packed, divided)
2 large eggs (lightly beaten)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup butter (melted, divided)
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup pecans (chopped)



Heat the oven to 350 F.

Butter a 2-quart casserole or baking dish.

In a large bowl, combine the mashed sweet potatoes with 1 cup of the brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, milk, and 1/2 cup of melted butter. Blend thoroughly and spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish.

In another bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of brown sugar, the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup of melted butter, and the chopped pecans.

Sprinkle the pecan topping mixture over the top of the sweet potato casserole.

Bake the casserole for 35 to 40 minutes, until the filling is hot and the topping has browned.
