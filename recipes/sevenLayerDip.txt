You Can't Have A Super Bowl Party Without This 7 Layer Dip
by Delish US

Is it really a Super Bowl party without the 7 layer dip?! This recipe has the perfect proportions of each layer, so you get the total combo in every scoop. 

Though we think this dip is best consumed in the first 24 hours, leftovers will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.

P.S. Check out our guacamole recipe if you wanna make yours from scratch. We think it makes a good dip even better. ðŸ™Œ
