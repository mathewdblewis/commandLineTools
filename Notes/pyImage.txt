A minimal working example of how to write make an image file using python



from PIL import Image; import numpy as np

ar  = [[[x,0,0] for x in range(256)] for _ in range(80)]
ar += [[[0,x,0] for x in range(256)] for _ in range(80)]
ar += [[[0,0,x] for x in range(256)] for _ in range(80)]

Image.fromarray(np.uint8(ar)).save('asdf.png')
